MDM - MongoDB Document Mapper
=============================

A super flexible MongoDB Document Mapper (Similar to [ROM](https://github.com/thejpanganiban/rom); Most of the code were
actually reused). It's all about model method DRY-ness.

Usage
-----

    var db = require('mdm').createDatabase('mongodb://localhost:27017', 'myDatabase');

    var User = db.Model.extend('User', {
      hello: function() {
        return "Hello, " + this.get('first_name');
      }
    });

    var mr_awesome = new User({first_name: "Awesome"});

    mr_awesome.save(function(err, mr_awesome) {
        console.log(mr_awesome.hello());
        console.log("Mr awesome mongo id: " + mr_awesome.get('_id'));
    });

    mr_awesome.destroy();


Installation
------------

    $ npm install mdm
